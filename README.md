# Fsssss

A quick clone (ish) of the classic [Snake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) written in F#.

## Dev notes

Mostly inspired by [@GarethIW's FShoot](http://www.garethpw.co.uk/2013/06/1gam-june-fshoot.html).

Welcome to a couple of evening's worth of my entertainment. I really wanted to have another crack at using XNA - and ***really*** wanted another crack and games dev with a functional language like `F#`. I'll probably use this as a point of reference if I do any more games dev, and maybe it'll serve as a little example for others.
